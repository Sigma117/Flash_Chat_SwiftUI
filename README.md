# Flash_Chat_SwiftUI
Creating a simple chat app using swiftUI and Firebase. The project is inspired by the flash chat illustrated in Angela Yu's Udemy course

## Project Intent

The goal of this project is to rewrite the app developed by Dr. Angela Yu, as demonstrated in the Udemy course [iOS 13 App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING), using SwiftUI. 

This app introduces various changes in the organization of functions and classes, but the core functionality remains the same: sending, loading, and saving messages on Firebase. The chat is shared among all users; any registered user has access to all the data on the server (i.e., there are no private chats between users, but rather one large group chat shared by all users).

### How to Use This Project

To use this project:
1. Change the `Bundle Identifier` in Xcode.
2. Set up your own Firebase database in Firestore Database.
3. Register your `Bundle Identifier` in your Firebase project.
